    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large coconut</li>
        <li>1.5 large cucumbers</li>
        <li>1 red chilli, deseeded</li>
        <li>Juice of 1 lime</li>
        <li>Juice of 1/2 lemon</li>
        <li>30g fresh coriander/cilantro</li>
        <li>50g radishes</li>
        <li>300ml tinned coconut milk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon caster sugar</li>
        <li>10g salt</li>
        <li>10g cracked black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Crack open a coconut and scrap out the flesh with knife.
            Cracking open the coconut in a sandwich bag by cracking it with a knife makes things much less messy.
        </li>
        <li>Grate the flesh with a grater, and toss it all in a large mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Skin the cucumbers, slice them in half longways, scoop out the fleshy middle with a spoon (discard it),
            then slice it into 2 inch cubes. This too goes into the mixing bowl.
        </li>
        <li>Scrape the seeds out from the red chili and discard, then cut it finely, and toss in the bowl.</li>
        <li>Slice half the radishes thinly, and grate the other half, putting both into the mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Roughly cut the coriander/cilantro and mix into the bowl along with salt and pepper. Mix the salad with your hands thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Pour coconut milk from the can along with juice from 1/2 a lemon, a whole lime's worth of juice,
            and a tbsp of sugar. Stir this concoction up with a spoon.
        </li>
        <li>Pour your newly mixed salad dressing over your salad as much as you'd like, then plate it up and serve. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
