        <h2>An unusual yet satisfying dish</h2>
        <p>Not many have heard of The Goop. Fewer yet have tried it, for fear of a potentially foul taste.</p>
        <p>But I, dear reader, am bringing this dish to the forefront of the culinary zeitgeist. This extravagant composition of gooey perfection can be assembled with common household ingredients, like glomp buns, and schleem!
            The taste of "The Goop" is akin to that of fermented jello. The main trick to cooking it is by assembling the gloorp balls precisely 2-inches apart from eachother in the baking tray
            , for optimal crispiness. Now, lets's dive into the ingredients.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup of flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons of gloop</li>
            <li>3 glomp buns</li>
            <li>6 oz of schleem</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of gloorp balls</li>
            <li>1 tbsp of white sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>First, take 3 glomp buns and dice them into 4 sections each.</li>
            <li>Pour 1 cup of flour, 2 teaspoons of gloop, and 6 oz of schleem in to a mixing bowl. Stir thoroughly until the mixture is evenly spread.</li>
            <li>Add 1 tbsp of sugar and 1/2 teaspoons baking soda, mix thoroughly.</li>
            <li>pour mixture onto a small 12-count baking tray</li>
            <li>Add gloorp balls onto molds equally</li>
            <li>place each 1/4 of the glomp buns on top of each cup.</li>
            <li>Set oven to -200 Fahrenheit and 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Be sure to thoroughly shake the tray after taking it out, and in small cups. Enjoy!!</li>
